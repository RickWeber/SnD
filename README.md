# SnD
Supply and Demand model implemented in NetLogo.

## What

This is an agent based model implementation of the classic Supply and Demand.

## How

To use the model, download the file 'SnD.nlogo' and open it in
[NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/download.shtml). 

To run the model, hit the "setup" button, then one of the three "go" buttons
(one of which runs the model for a single iteration, another for 10, and another
runs it until the stopping condition is met).

The code for the model is available in the code tab.
